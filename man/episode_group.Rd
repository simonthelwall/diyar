episode_group(df, sn = NULL, strata = NULL, date, episode_length,
  episode_type = "static", episodes_max = Inf,

}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe}

\item{sn}{Unique record indentifiers for the dataframe}

\item{strata}{Column(s) to stratify the dataset while grouping into episodes. Episodes will be unique to each strata}

\item{date}{Date associated with the record date. A column of `date` type}

\item{episode_length}{Episode duration/window in calendar days. Integer values between `0` and `Inf`, and should be unique to each `strata`}

\item{episode_type}{"static" or "rolling". If "static", each episode will only include records within a fixed period (`episode_length`) from the inital record (case). If "rolling", will include recurrent records}

\item{episodes_max}{An integer between `0` and `Inf` indicating the number of episod windows for each strata.}

\item{rc_episode_length}{Period of recurrence in calendar days. Recurrence here refers to records ocurring after `episode_length` of the first record but within the `rc_episode_length` of the last duplicate record. Only used if `episode_type` is "rolling". Should also be unique to each strata, be between `0` and `Inf`}

\item{rolls_max}{An integer between `0` and `Inf` indicating the maximum number of recurrent record(s) for each episode. Only used if `episode_type` is "rolling".}

\item{data_source}{A column of unique dataset indentifier(s) for the dataframe. Usefull when grouping episodes from mutliple datasets.}

\item{from_last}{If TRUE, episode groupping will be backwards in time, starting from the most recent record to the earliest. If FALSE, it'll be forward in time starting from the earliest record.}

\item{display}{If TRUE, progress status at each stage of episode grouping is displayed on screen}
}

# By deafult, episodes are defined within a fixed window period of `episode_length` in calendar days. Any record after this window period is assigned to a new episode
# Changing `episode_type` to "rolling" will change this behaviour to account for "Recurring" recording.
# "Recurring" records occur after the episode `episode_length` of the primary "Case" but within `rc_episode_length` of the last "duplicate" or "recurrent" case
# The primary "case" and all subsequent "Recurring" cases are assigned to the same episode. If the next chronological record is not a "Recurring" case, it's assigned to a new epsiode.
# The example below demonstrates this

# By default, `episode_length` is for `rc_episode_length`. A different window period for recurrent records can be specied using the `rc_episode_length` argument.
# The example below demonsrates the difference between an `episode_length` and `rc_episode_length` of 13 calendar days compared to an `episode_length` of 13 calendar days and `rc_episode_length` of 60 calendar days
# Both example yield one episode (`epid`) however, the first has 1 primary "case" and 4 "recurrent" records while the second has 1 primary "Case" and 2 recurrent "records"
